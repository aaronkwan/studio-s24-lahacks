## Premise
- You are out in the wild. Collect sticks to fuel your campfire. If it gets too small, you lose.

On Keyboard:
- Hold `WASD` to move.
- Hold `SHIFT` to sprint.
- Press `SPACE` to shine your beacon and light up nearby sticks. However, it can only flash every 4 seconds (to prevent overheating).
- Press `ESC` to pause at any time.
- Press `+` and `-` to modify your campfire's lifetime (if you like cheating).

On Mobile:
- Tap and Drag to move.
- Hold `Shift` button to sprint.
- Tap `Flash light` button to shine your beacon.
- Tap `==` button to pause.
